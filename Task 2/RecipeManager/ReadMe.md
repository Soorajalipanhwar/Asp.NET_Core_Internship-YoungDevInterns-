# This is the second task of YoungDev Interns internship

This is a Web app with basic CRUD funtionality and Bootstrap Styling.
The application has three views, _dashboard_ view for the list of all recipes,
an _edit view_ for editing the existing recipes and a _detailed_ view for displaying the full information of a recipe and its instructions.

I have used _ASP.NET 8 Core_ mvc and _Entity Framework core_ with _SQL Server_ to creeate the backend and front end of the application
