This is a Web app with basic CRUD funtionality and Bootstrap Styling.
The application has three views, **dashboard view** for the list of all recipes,
an **edit vie** for editing the existing recipes and a **detailed** view for displaying the full information of a recipe and its instructions.

- I have used **ASP.NET 8 Core** mvc and **Entity Framework core** with **SQL Server** to creeate the backend and front end of the application
